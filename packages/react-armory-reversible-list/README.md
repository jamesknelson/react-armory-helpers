# react-armory-reversible-list

This package is designed to demonstrate why you need `key` props on React Elements in arrays. It exports a `ReversibleList` component that expects a single array as a child, and renders these children along with a "Reverse" button -- which will only work if the child array has keys.

## Exports

- `<ReversibleList children={array}>`

## Why?
